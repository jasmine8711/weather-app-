#Weather App
ou can enter your city and the app will show you the next five days of weather in your city. Temperature will show together with a 'stamp' that describes the weather in Chinese. Don't worry if you can not read Chinese, you will find the English information below the Chinese characters. I made three different interfaces: mobile, tablet, and desktop. On your computer, it wil also show a random image of your city.
